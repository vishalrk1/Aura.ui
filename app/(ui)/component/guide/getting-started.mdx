Welcome to the Aura UI! This guide will help you integrate the library into your React or Next.js project with ease. Follow the steps below to get started quickly.

# Installation

To begin, install the library along with its required peer dependencies:

## Step 1: Install the Package

Use the following command to add the library to your project:

```bash
npm install framer-motion tailwindcss
# or
yarn add framer-motion tailwindcss
# or
pnpm add framer-motion tailwindcss
```

## Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS

If you donâ€™t already have Tailwind CSS set up in your project, follow these steps:

<br />
1. Install Tailwind CSS:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

<br />
2. Update `tailwind.config.js` to include the library components in the `content` array:

   ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', // Adjust according to your file structure
        './node_modules/animated-ui-library/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {
          colors: {
            themeGreen: "#a5fecb",
            grayBg: "#191e1f",
            grayBorder: "#292d2e",
          }
        },
      },
      plugins: [
        plugin(({ addUtilities }) => {
          addUtilities({
            ".text-small": {
              fontSize: "12px",
              letterSpacing: "0.01px",
            },
            ".text-default": {
              fontSize: "14px",
              lineHeight: "21px",
              letterSpacing: "-0.09px",
            },
          });
        }),
      ],
    };
   ```
<br />
3. Add Tailwind directives to your CSS file (e.g., `globals.css`):

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

<br />

# Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can start using the libraryâ€™s components:

## Step 1: Import Components

Each component is fully optimized for animations with Framer Motion and styled with Tailwind CSS. Import the components into your React or Next.js project:

```javascript
import { AnimatedButton, AnimatedCard } from 'animated-ui-library';
```

## Step 2: Customize with Tailwind Classes

You can easily customize each component using Tailwind classes:

```jsx
<AnimatedButton className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700 text-white">
  Click Me!
</AnimatedButton>
```

# Animations
All components in this library leverage **Framer Motion** for animations. You can customize animations as needed:


### Adding Custom Animations

Pass motion properties directly to components:

```jsx
<AnimatedCard
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  className="w-64 h-32 bg-purple-500 text-white"
>
  Custom Animated Card
</AnimatedCard>
```

# Common Issues
<br />
1. **Tailwind Classes Not Working:**
   - Ensure the `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured to include the libraryâ€™s components.
   
2. **Framer Motion Not Installed:**
   - Check that `framer-motion` is installed as a dependency.
